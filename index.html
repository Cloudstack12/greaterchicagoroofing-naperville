                    To prepare for future storms and protect your home, it’s essential to have a plan in place. This may include having emergency supplies on hand, such as a generator, flashlight, and water, in case of power outages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s also a good idea to have a plan to secure loose items, such as outdoor furniture, and to have a communication plan in place with family members or roommates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also essential to be aware of severe weather warnings and to stay informed about the weather forecast during the storm season. Additionally, you should check your insurance policy and ensure it covers any damage caused by storms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, maintaining the integrity of your roof is essential to ensure the longevity and safety of your home. Storms can cause significant damage to roofs, so it’s vital to be aware of the signs of wear and to take steps to repair them promptly.
